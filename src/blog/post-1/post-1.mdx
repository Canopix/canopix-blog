It's weird write a first post about the first post. 
In my mind, my blog was going to start with a few post series and genuinely content, but I realize that it is better a humble start and growing step by step among all of you. 

So following that, my intentions are clear: 
Create content that helps anybody to learn about web development. 
Have a place to share the results of my curiosity
Have an excellent moment writing content in a language that is not my mother tongue (Thanks Grammarly for being a fantastic tool)

The main topics to write about are Front-end development, remote working, and work-life balance (the last one will be a place where I'm going to share some of my opinions about life and how to face some situations at work and more related).

Beginning with this, we can continue with the topic of this post! 

## Getting things in place quickly:

One of the most painful experiences as a front-end developer at the beginning (also when you have a few years on this) is related to "How can I Center something in the middle of the screen, div or a parent in general?". 

Trust me, I had a few headaches with this for a long time, mainly when solutions like CSS Grid or Flexbox was not in the scene. 

But now, we are here, in this era, and with a lot of ways to do this, I'm going to focus on two methods: Flexbox and CSS Grid, (why? Because I want and also, are easy to learn :) )

So, if you are not familiar with Flexbox or CSS Grid, you need to understand that these are not fighting for your attention. You can work with both getting benefits of using one or another depending on the situation. 

To resume (very short ninja resume level 5), CSS Grid is a system that allows you to create layouts in two dimensions easily. Flexbox gives you the possibility to order content in one dimension with a few lines of code (also, you can make layouts too, the limit is how much you're comfortable with one or both of these techniques).

## Flexbox

As I said earlier, one dimension and gives you the control of elements with a few lines of code.
So, to understand "How to center a div with Flexbox," you need to know how to Flexbox position elements vertically and horizontally, or both at the same time. 

If you want to see your elements in a row, you need to use 

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
```

And if you are looking for a column of elements, need: 

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
```

So, EMANUEL, where the hell are those centered positions on flexbox? Take it easy! We will get there very soon!  

If you combine two CSS properties of flexbox, you can get an item centered horizontally and vertically.

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

So easy! I dare you to play removing `justify-content` or `align-items` to see how it work.

     sandbox="allow-autoplay allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"

# CSS Grid


With CSS Grid, you only need one line of code to place the items at the center:

```
  place-items: center;
```
The place-items property in CSS is shorthand for the align-items and justify-items properties, combining them into a single declaration.

 Now you know how to center something in the middle of a parent, screen or anything that you want.
 A simple trick to start a new blog, sound a deal to me. 

### This is the end of the beginning of my blog, So if you are here, is because you read everything (or scrolled to here) and I'm thankful to you for that, I hope being honored with your visit soon! Thanks!
