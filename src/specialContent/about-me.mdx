Hello All! 
At the moment to start writing this section, I asked myself:

What I want to tell anyone interested in my person? 

To who is interested more in Who I am? And not in the full history of my life, I can say I'm a curious person who is interested in changing the world for the end-users through code.
I was fascinated with the feeling of knowing that code that I do change the life of the people who experience it.

Sometimes only is saving time, and others are the whole experience of making something new in a simple way; that's is why I'm working at this side of the keyboard.`



# The Long Journey to knowing me

So, thinking about that, I created a list with a few topics, but too soon, that list grew infinitely, so I think it is fair to start from the beginning of the beginnings.

My name is Emanuel Mathias Canova, born in 1991 (you can do the math and don't telling me anything about that ðŸ¤£) in Rio Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Argentina (in the south of the country, land of strong winds, cold wheater and occasionally snow in the winter).



## My first contact with computers and programming

I can remember the exact moment seeing my father enter my home with a big box and telling me, "The future is here now." and right was he at that moment. 

He brought home a marvelous computer with a Pentium I 100Mhz,  32MB of RAM, and Windows 95. I remember how anxious was I for a PC magazine that was released every month (PC USERS) and was coming with a CD every time.

A few years later, playing with Microsoft Office and more accurately with Excel, I read about VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). With the help of a walkthrough from PC USERS magazine, I made my first macro (a basic calculator) and that among touching Regedit on windows explode on my head in several ways. 

Another thing that I can remember the feeling of being a cheater in the videogames but through code. Some videogames at that time make their savegame in XML and investigating that I could change my gold amount in a game that now I do not remember the name. 




## My present on this side of the screen

Today, after years of creating solutions for all of the kinds of problems, I can encounter myself remotely working for a fabulous company with a lot of great people with passion and dedication, is motivating. 

But ever there are more ways to contribute to the community and the world, for that reason:

I created this personal blog, and on each opportunity to present a talk at a conference, I try to be the first on the line with an exciting topic to motivate others to learn and share with other devs (you can look into my Talk section here).

If you reach this lastest word, I want to say Thanks!  I know that my page will bring you compelling articles and topics to read & learn!
